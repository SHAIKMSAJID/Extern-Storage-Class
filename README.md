# Extern-Storage-Class
I've learnt about Extern storage class and its application.
While sharing a variable in between 2 files while working on a project....it will be beneficial to use extern keyword...so that memory allocation will be reduced.
Here in the above files extern is separate program which displays the functionality of extern keyword in single file.
file1.c and support.c are 2 files interconnected with each other using extern keyword...those 2 files are linked using Linker.
